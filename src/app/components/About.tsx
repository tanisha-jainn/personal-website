            Last semester, I worked with a team at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-england/" style={{ color: '#C8A2C8', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Microsoft&apos;s Cambridge office</a> to help with AI Prompt Efficiency. Our goal was to measure the quality and relevance of prompts in producing desired outcomes. This past summer, I interned at <a href="https://toolhouse.com/" style={{ color: '#C8A2C8', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Toolhouse</a>, a life sciences digital agency, where I automated their sales analysis tactics using Pandas and NumPy. Along with that, I was admitted to join a team at MITs Schwarzman College of Computing as a <a href="https://www.breakthroughtech.org/programs/the-ai-program/" style={{ color: '#C8A2C8', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>BreakThroughTech</a> AI Fellow.
